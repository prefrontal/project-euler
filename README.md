Solutions to Project Euler problems

I have been working through the archive of Project Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net) as a personal challenge and as coding practice.  This repository contains the answers, data files, and standalone algorithms that I have used to solve these problems.  My goal is to complete at least fifty Project Euler problems by the end of 2015.

Edit: 50 answers on September 9, 2015!
