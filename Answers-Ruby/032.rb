# Project Euler Problem 32, Ruby
#
# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use 
# of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit 
# number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
# 
# The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, 
# containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
# 
# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product 
# identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
# 
# HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so 
# be sure to only include it once in your sum.
# 
# Answer: 45228

# The first attempt was a brute-force search through millions of number combinations
# This was a bit extreme and took significant time to run.  Instead, we now only
# look over the permutations of a pandigital number, dividing each permutation into
# many divisions of multiplicand, multiplier, and product.  
# This takes twenty three seconds in Ruby.

# Computes the next lexicographical permutation of the specified
# array of numbers in place, returning whether a next permutation
# existed. (Returns false when the argument is already the last
# possible permutation.)
