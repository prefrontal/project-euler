# Project Euler Problem 22
#
# Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, 
# begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical 
# value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the 
# list to obtain a name score.
# 
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is 
# worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would 
# obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
# 
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
#
# Answer: 871198282
